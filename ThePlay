//here's the game plan, coach

//front end-
//we make a java GUI and make it cute, like me
//maybe even JS or CSS if we feel like doing it
//aight bruv JS and CSS are two different thangs
CS is for being cute af
JS is for puttin in that (ugh, yeah, put in) WERK
//WAY different
//takes:
//class name
//category number of graded
//names
//weights
//grades
//category number not graded
//names
//prints:
//a cute message ab how fucked you are
//maybe pick class mode v gpa mode? focus on a single class
//also a mode for just calculating a grade

//back end-
//takes graded categories and calculates current grade
//makes a function or sum ab how fucked you are
//different functionalities (what do I need on final, what's my final grade, etc)


Doing it way different - A brief interlude by Marc Mekhanik
k so my pal suggested that we do the functions and what not on the front end
for a couple reasons
1. This way, everything executes on the client side, which is more efficient for the server
2. Doing the functions in Java requires the client to have Java installed, 
whereas doing it in javascript allows it to work in every browser
3. Since JS is a web language, it plays better with HTML
4. Java has a lot of security vulnerabilities in the way it transfers data, so it has little support
(my friend told me this I don't know why it's vulnerable)
5. I personally have no idea how to run the java in the html. Something about applets. 
So I've been and will to continue to be working with JS.
